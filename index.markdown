# Identifying the problem
We noticed the problem upon a combination of market research, feedback from the customers from various stores, and personal observation. In the initial phase, a series of questionnaires for frequent shoppers highlighted the frustration with managing multiple loyalty applications. 
By observing the market, we further confirmed that the average smartphone user is increasingly concerned about the number of apps they manage, and clutter is a growing problem.

The increase in the number of apps has caused many people to feel exasperated, which describes the concept of [App Fatigue](https://www.storyly.io/post/too-many-apps-for-that-app-fatigue). Moreover, [it only takes a week](https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/most-apps-get-deleted-within-a-week) for the average smartphone user to delete an app. At the same time, [30% of app downloads in North America—as measured by Tune’s customers between November 2017 and May 2018—were reinstalls](https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/smartphone-users-are-reinstalling-apps-at-a-surprisingly-high-rate).

Looking into the Romanian market of applications, we found multiple platforms for  retailer chains, fast-food stores, and even jewelry shops.

Moreover, certain platforms, such as Starbucks, only offer a web-like layout, which is not optimized for mobile devices. What is more, it requires the user to log in every time they want to access the platform. While preinstalled solutions, such as Apple Wallet, include multiple cards, it is not possible to see the points balance or redeem rewards.

# How to beat app fatigue
The solution envisioned is PunctConnect, an app designed to consolidate various loyalty programs into one platform. By offering a centralized loyalty program management system, PunctConnect aims to reduce app clutter, save phone storage space, and simplify the user experience.

# Customer discovery
The customer discovery plan includes conducting surveys with numerous participants who frequently use loyalty programs. The goal is to understand their habits, preferences, and pain points. The survey will be conducted online, in a Google Form, and the participants will be recruited through social media. 
dentifying Customer Segments


* Demographics: Target customers who are frequent shoppers, both online and in physical stores, and who use smartphones.
* Behaviors: Focus on those who actively participate in loyalty programs and have expressed frustration with the current system.
* Outreach Methods: Utilize social media platforms and messaging apps to reach out to potential customers.

## Questions for the Form
1. How many loyalty program apps do you use regularly?
2. What are your biggest frustrations with the current loyalty program apps?
3. How important is storage space on your phone to you?
4. What features are most important to you in a loyalty program app?
5. How often do you engage with loyalty programs weekly?
6. How likely are you to switch to an app that consolidates all your loyalty programs?

# Insights
The full results of the survey are provided in the following [report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XY4y7p-2wnplP2ZGdmFMZ4Tz_4TacI1N/view?usp=sharing).
* All of the participants use at least one loyalty program app. Moreover, more than 6 out of 10 use at least 2 apps.
* People are mostly frustrated that they are not notified about the offfers of the store and that they have to install several apps. Therefore, our focus will be on these two aspects so that the users will not miss any offer.
* Less than 3 out of 10 individuals do not care about the storage space issue on their phone. As a result, while we will take into account the storage space issue, it will not be a priority.
* An overwhelming amount of people would appreciate that a loyalty program app should be easy to use. Moreover, they would like to be in touch with the newest offers of their favorite retailers.
* ~90% of the participants use loyalty platforms at least once a week.
* An overwhelming 90.5 percent of the participants would switch to an app that consolidates all their loyalty programs. Out of these, 52.4 percent would switch immediately.

# Customer Validation stage plans
Given the insights obtained from customer discovery, it is reasonable to move to the customer validation stage. Here’s why:
* Product-Market Fit: There is a clear need for the solution PunctConnect offers.
* User Feedback: We now understand what future expectations are given the problems outlined by the users. Therefore, we can focus on tailoring the product to meet these expectations.
* Market Research: We have compared our solution to the competition and their users. As a result, we can now build a viable solution that exceeds the expectations of the users and the competition.

In the future, we want to develop a Minimum Viable Product so that the users can test it. We will gather feedback and the following iterations will ensure that the solution fits the needs of the users. By using metrics such as time spent on the app and how often the users access it, we will be able to measure the engagement of the users. Finally, we are ready to validate the assumptions about user behavior through real-world testing. 

# Landing page
The customers are greeted with a straight-to-the-point, modernly-designed [landing page](https://punctconnect.github.io/demo) designed to elevate their interaction with the platform.

# Wireframe
This is how we imagine the flow of the platform. Keep in mind that this is just an ideea and the mockup might look slightly different.
